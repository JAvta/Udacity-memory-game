## Gameplay

**Memory Game Logic**

The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.

**Congratulations Popup**

When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It also tell the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.

**Restart Button**

A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.

**Star Rating**

The game displays a star rating (from 1-3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it displays 3 stars. After some number of moves, it changes to a 2 star rating. After a few more moves, it changes to a 1 star rating.

**Timer**

When the player starts a game, a displayed timer also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.

**Move Counter**

Game displays the current number of moves a user has made.

## Instructions

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. I have converted this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

For more specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is my own project using the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
